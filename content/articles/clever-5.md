summary: "In software development, there are many ways to solve a problem.  Choosing one of them is a skill."

The fun in computer science is when a problem presents itself as a puzzle.  Some homework was even
enjoyable, I do enjoy puzzles.  I recall one particular problem, or rather, one particular solution
that took me awhile to work out.  I was quite happy with it once I made it through all the
difficulties, it was complete and worked in every case I could think of.

When I received it back, it was marked with a 95% grade.  The only annotation was a red-marked one
in the middle:
> Clever, -5

I ... didn't really know what that meant.  I've been called clever before, but it always seemed like
a positive attribute.  I asked the professor for clarification.  He shared, "Yes, you solved the
problem, but in a roundabout way.  Is there a straightforward answer?"

I still leave the same comment on code reviews on occasion.  "Clever, -5."  There are many ways to
solve a problem.  Taking the first one that comes to mind isn't always the best course of action.
There may be a more straightforward way to accomplish what you're trying to do.

Thanks for the lesson Dr. Lang.
