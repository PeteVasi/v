summary: "Cubes pixel art for April."
---

Metroid for April's pixel art made with Rubik's Cubes.  This one was tricky just because the green
and blue are quite similar in color so hard to make out when put together.  I settled on a white outer
glow-type effect for the Metroid to have it contrast better.
