Happy Mario Day!  March's pixel art made with Rubik's Cubes.

Trying something a little different this time, and changing the visible date on the cubes each day throughout the month.  I managed to align the last digit
of the month on a 3x3 boundary, so I only need to arrange two cubes on most of the days.  So far it's worked out.
